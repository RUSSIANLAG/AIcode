(These queries should not use English noun phrases!) You can use more queries, 
but at least all 6 queries mentioned above. It is up to you to formulate a range 
of queries that demonstrates that your program works properly. Keep your queries 
and answers computed by Prolog in the file nlu.txt
Once you have this working, you are ready to consider English noun phrases 
and the accounts they refer to. Here are some examples of the kinds of queries 
your system should be able to answer:

%Number is account number
%Name is account holder name
%Bank is the location of this bank
%Balance is the current balance on the account

account(Number, Name, Bank, Balance).
created(Number,Name, Bank, Month, Year).
lives(P, City). P = person name 
location(X,C). X = city C = country
